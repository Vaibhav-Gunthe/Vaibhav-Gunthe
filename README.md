👋 Hi, I’m Vaibhav Gunthe

👀 I’m interested in VLSI design, neural computing, and AI hardware acceleration.  
🌱 I’m currently learning Verilog, RTL design, and working on a Tiny NPU for AI inference.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on VLSI-based AI projects, FPGA designs, and digital hardware implementations....   
📫 How to reach me: [gunthevaibhav@gmail.com]    
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy debugging hardware designs 🛠️ more than fixing software bugs 🐞!
